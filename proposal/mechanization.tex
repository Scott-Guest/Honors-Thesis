\section{Mechanization}\label{sec:mechanization}
As discussed, pattern matching with holes in both expressions and patterns can be quite intricate, requiring reasoning about a three-valued logic of necessarily, necessarily not, and indeterminate judgments. Thus, even with on-paper proofs showing that such a system is correct, it can be difficult to have full confidence that all possibilities have been considered. Anecdotally, the current in-progress work on this system already contains some 150+ pages of tediously typed out proofs, and is likely to contain at least a few mistakes. To address this, we plan toechanize the semantics and metatheory of our calculus in the Agda proof-assistant.

Briefly, Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language based on a variant of Martin-L\"of type theory known as the Unified Theory of Dependent Types \todo{cite}. With dependent types, the division between types and values becomes blurry - types may be parameterized by arbitrary values, and types may be given as an argument or result of functions. Moreover, through the well-known Curry-Howard correspondence aka "types as propositions", a type $T$ may be considered as equivalent to the proposition "$T$ is inhabited". By designing appropriate datatypes, types may then encode mathematical statements, and constructing an Agda term of that type provides proof of the statement's correctness.  \todo{cite}.
